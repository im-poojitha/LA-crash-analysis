# üöó LA Crash Accident Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing motor vehicle crash data from Los Angeles using Python. It aims to uncover patterns in traffic accidents, such as common locations, and contributing factors. The analysis uses powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Tutorial Base**: This project follows the YouTube tutorial by [Deep Charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9mt37nd2kg&t=2s), used for learning and skill-building.
- **Tools & Libraries**:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Folium
  - H3
  - Jupyter Notebook

## üñºÔ∏è Heatmap Visualization

Here's a heatmap of crash locations in LA:

## üß† Skills Practiced

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Use H3 package to locate Latitudes and Longitudes
- Visualizing data distributions through Heat Maps using Folium

I followed this tutorial to practice data analysis workflows and improve my skills in pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I have added small modifications and explored parts of the data on my own as part of the learning process.
